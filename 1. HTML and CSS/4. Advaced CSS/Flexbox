Understanding flexbox
Much like the div and box container that you can create using HTML, flexbox is a type of container. Flexbox can overcome the limitations caused by containers such as block and inline because it does a better job of scaling over larger web pages and also provides more dynamic control of the containers. This is because it can grow, shrink and align the items inside it which give better control to the programmer over the contents and styling of the items inside the container.
