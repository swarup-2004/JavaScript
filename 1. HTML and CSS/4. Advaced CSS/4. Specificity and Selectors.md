# CSS Specificity and Selectors

## Introduction
As you build a website, the complexity of the code might increase to such a point that more than one CSS rule is applied to the same element. When this happens, CSS engines use **specificity** to resolve conflicts. Specificity is a ranking system that determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element.

This guide will help you understand how specificity works and how the most specific rule is selected by CSS.

## Specificity Hierarchy
CSS assigns a **weight** to different types of selectors to create a specificity hierarchy. These categories, from highest to lowest specificity, are:

1. **Inline styles**
2. **IDs**
3. **Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes**
4. **Elements and pseudo-elements**

### 1. Inline Styles
Inline styles have the highest specificity and override all other rules.

```html
<p style="color: white;">Text</p>
```

Even if there is a conflicting rule like:

```css
p { color: blue; }
```

The `<p>` tag will still be **white** because inline styles take precedence.

### 2. ID Selectors
ID selectors (`#id`) come next in specificity.

```css
#header {
  color: red;
}
```

IDs are unique and should be used sparingly.

### 3. Classes, Attributes, and Pseudo-classes
Classes (`.class`), attributes (`[attr]`), and pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`) have lower specificity than IDs but higher than element selectors.

```css
.my-class {
  color: green;
}

p[title] {
  font-weight: bold;
}

div:hover {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

### 4. Elements and Pseudo-elements
Element selectors (`div`, `p`, `h1`) and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) have the lowest specificity.

```css
div {
  margin: 20px;
}

p::first-line {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

## Calculating Specificity Scores
CSS uses a **numeric scoring system** to determine specificity. The scores are assigned based on the selector types:

| Selector Type                     | Score  |
|------------------------------------|--------|
| Inline styles                      | 1000   |
| ID selectors (`#id`)               | 100    |
| Classes, attributes, pseudo-classes (`.class`, `[attr]`, `:hover`) | 10 |
| Elements and pseudo-elements (`div`, `p`, `::before`) | 1 |

Each part of a selector contributes to the final score. Let's analyze some examples:

### Example 1
```css
p {}          /* 0001 */
div p {}      /* 0002 */
div p.foo {}  /* 0012 */
```

- `p {}` â†’ **Score: 1**
- `div p {}` â†’ **Score: 2**
- `div p.foo {}` â†’ **Score: 12** (1 class selector + 2 element selectors)

Since `div p.foo {}` has the highest specificity (score **12**), its rules will be applied.

### Example 2
```css
p#bar {}     /* 0101 */
p.foo {}     /* 0011 */
p.p.foo {}   /* 0021 */
```

- `p#bar {}` â†’ **Score: 101** (1 ID + 1 element)
- `p.foo {}` â†’ **Score: 11** (1 class + 1 element)
- `p.p.foo {}` â†’ **Score: 21** (2 classes + 1 element)

Since `p#bar {}` has the highest specificity (**101**), its rules will be applied.

## Additional Specificity Rules
1. **Every selector has a specificity score.**
2. **If selectors have the same specificity, the last rule in the CSS file is applied.**
3. **ID selectors should only be used when necessary to ensure uniqueness.**
4. **Universal selectors (`*`) have zero specificity.**

---

## The Cascade in CSS
Specificity is part of what makes CSS **cascading**. The cascade determines which styles apply based on specificity, importance (`!important`), and source order.

If you ever struggle with specificity, you can use **CSS specificity calculators** to analyze your styles.
